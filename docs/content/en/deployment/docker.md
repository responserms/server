## Before You Start

Before you stat, take note of the following:

### Assumptions

This guide makes a few assumptions about the reader but is overall meant to be simple for all readers to follow. The following assumptions are made:

- You are familiar with running commands in a terminal
- You are using a machine with Docker and `docker-compose` already installed
- You are able to edit files on the machine where you will be deploying Response Server via Docker.

### Rationale

This guide is intended for running Response Server at any scale, though local development is typically easier with the `response-server` binary.

This guide does not cover maintenance tasks such as backing up data or performing OS updates.

## Get Started

### Single-Server Docker

### Docker Swarm
