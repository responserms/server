"""
All pagination in the API should use a cursor. This input is the same for every API
and allows the user to request records before and/or after a specific cursor (ID).

By default the pagination limit is 25 and any other limit, as long as it is within
the maximum that the administrator configures, can be requested by setting `limit`
to the appropriate number of records to return in each response.

Cursor-based pagination is sometimes more difficult to grasp than page-based
pagination, however, it works better with continuous scrolling and when data is
constantly changing. This is because cursors do not require that the data returned
be static and no items will be skipped if they fall behind/ahead of the threshold
before the next request.

Note that although IDs returned from the API are string-based, they map back into
numeric IDs in the database so all cursors use the actual identifier itself rather
than the timestamp of the record referred to.
